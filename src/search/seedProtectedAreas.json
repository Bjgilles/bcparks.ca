Boaters can find anchorage in the bay, which can be a welcome refuge from the windy and open waters of the Strait of Georgia.<br>  <br>This small park is a pleasant place to enjoy a picnic or spend a day exploring the rocky headlands and arid terrain, which is barren but beautiful. Visitors can walk around the park and out onto the headland, which offers views of distant Mount Baker to the east and the Comox Valley, capped by the stunning white expanse of the Comox Glacier, to the west. Be careful where you walk and sit, as ground-hugging prickly pear cacti grow here alongside Rocky Mountain juniper, far from its montane habitat.<br>     <br>Camping is not allowed in the park, and the only facilities are picnic tables, pit toilets and a public dock.<br><br><strong>Established Date:</strong> June 16, 1988<br>     <br><strong>Park Size:</strong> 12 hectares<br>     <br><strong>Stay Safe: </strong>     <ul><li>Several rocks obstruct the entrance to the bay.

Park, B.C.&rsquo;s largest marine park, consists of a wonderful collection of dozens of undeveloped islands and islets situated at the mouth of Knight Inlet on the west side of Queen Charlotte Strait near the north end of Vancouver Island.</p><p>Established in 1992, Broughton Archipelago Park offers excellent boating, kayaking and wildlife viewing opportunities. A multitude of islands provides park visitors sheltered waters and anchorages with a backdrop of the magnificent coastal mountains to the east and the waters of Queen Charlotte Strait to the west. These islands have been utilized by First Nation peoples for generations and there is ample evidence of their extensive use of the area. Kayakers and boaters can easily &ldquo;discover&rdquo; white midden beaches, culturally modified trees, clam &ldquo;terraces&rdquo; and even a petroglyph while exploring the park.</p><p>This park is extremely popular with sea kayakers from around the world. Most kayakers prefer the southern portion of the park, though increasing numbers are starting to discover the beauty of the northern islands and their protected waterways.</p><p>Please remember to practise &ldquo;<a href=\"\"/explore/notrace.html\"\">Leave No Trace</a>&rdquo; ethics when visiting this park.</p><p><strong>Established Date:</strong> September 16, 1992 <br><strong>Park Size:</strong> 11,751 hectares (2,061 ha of upland and 9,690 ha of foreshore)<br></p>","safetyInfo":null,"specialNotes":null,"locationNotes":null,"parkContact":null,"reservations":"","maps":"","natureAndCulture":null,"reconciliationNotes":"We honour their connection to the land and respect the importance of their diverse teachings, traditions and practices within these territories.

a few of the reasons to visit Bodega Ridge Provincial Park, located on Galiano Island in the southern Gulf Islands. The highlight of this day-use only park is a 4-km ridge rising 328 metres above sea level. The top of the ridge can be reached in approximately 30 minutes via a trail that leads uphill along the top of Bodega Ridge, through a forested area and along the cliff edge. From the top, hikers will be rewarded with spectacular vistas of Trincomali Channel, Vancouver Island and the Strait of Georgia.     </p>     <p>The park&rsquo;s high cliffs are home to bald eagles, peregrine falcons and turkey vultures. Unique sandstone formations on the water&rsquo;s edge below support large wildflower populations, which are known for their splendour and can be enjoyed by passing boaters and paddlers. Although this park has no developed facilities, its inspiring scenery makes it a popular destination for both visitors and island residents.     </p>     <p>      <strong>Date Established:</strong> April 11, 2001      <br>      <strong>Park Size:</strong> 397 hectares (321 hectares of upland and 76 hectares of foreshore)      <br>     </p>","safetyInfo":null,"specialNotes":null,"locationNotes":null,"parkContact":null,"reservations":"","maps":"","natureAndCulture":null,"reconciliationNotes":"We honour their connection to the land and respect the importance of their diverse teachings, traditions and practices within these territories.

The lake is known for shorebirds, with some relatively rare species such as American avocets, which are attracted to the rich alkaline shoreline.<br>     <br>The top of Buse Hill offers expansive views of surrounding landscapes of the Thompson Basin. The hike to the top of the hill from the south is relatively  short and easy. The north facing terrain above Buse Lake rises steeply through forested slopes to a high cliff face, topped by rocky summits. The 200 meter high cliff formations include a impressive detached rock tower. The steeply sloping terrain on the south side of the park drops down into upper grassland habits on adjacent grazing lease lands.<br>     <br>Local rockhound enthusiasts have collected blue opal from the area immediately adjacent to the park, lying southwest of Buse Lake. While most of the rock hounding activity occurs outside of the park, there is some interest in using the park. Rock hounding activities in the park are confined to low impact rock chipping and surface collecting. The Park exhibits some of the diversity of rock types found in the Robbins Range, which originate from Cenozoic (Upper Triassic), Mesozoic and Paleozoic eras. The lower portions are comprised of volcanics and the upper slopes are a complex array of basalts, breccia, schists  and conglomerates.<br><br><strong>Established Date:</strong> January 25, 2001<br>     <br><strong>Park Size:</strong> 228 hectares","safetyInfo":null,"specialNotes":null,"locationNotes":null,"parkContact":null,"reservations":"","maps":"","natureAndCulture":null,"reconciliationNotes":"We honour their connection to the land and respect the importance of their diverse teachings, traditions and practices within these territories.

Named for the pioneer who built Port Alberni&rsquo;s earliest sawmill, this park is an amalgamation of Stamp Falls and Money&rsquo;s Pool provincial parks.</p><p>One of the park&rsquo;s main attractions is the annual run of thousands of Pacific salmon circling in the pool below Stamp Falls before ascending the fish ladders on their way to spawning beds. Lookout points along the river offer excellent views of the salmon fighting their way up the falls and fish ladders. This natural phenomenon occurs every year, starting in late August with sockeye and continuing with coho and Chinook right into December.</p><p>The salmon are a draw for black bear as well, who head to the river for an easy meal. As always when in wilderness areas, safety precautions should be taken. While fishing within the park boundaries is not permitted, this park is a popular base camp for anglers fishing other parts of the Stamp River, as well as visitors traveling to and from the Pacific Rim.<br><br><strong>Established Date:</strong> December 20, 1940<br><strong>Park Size:</strong> 327 hectares <br></p>","safetyInfo":null,"specialNotes":null,"locationNotes":null,"parkContact":null,"reservations":"All campsite reservations must be made through <a href=\"\"http://www.discovercamping.ca/\"\">Discover Camping</a>.

three provincial parks on Gabriola Island, Drumbeg is a favourite      spot for diving, hiking, nature viewing and picnicking. Overlooking scenic      Gabriola Passage on the east end of the Island, Drumbeg offers excellent      views of the Strait of Georgia and the Coast Mountains on the Mainland.      The park contains a kilometre long sand and pebble beach with striking      sandstone and conglomerate rock formations, which can be seen at low tide.     </p>     <p>Drumbeg Park protects endangered Garry oak ecosystems, undeveloped Douglas      fir forest landscapes and a diverse marine zone. Species such as Bald      eagles, Great Blue herons, harbour seals and American oystercatchers can      be spotted here, along with a number of intertidal creatures. Underwater      enthusiasts can dive from the shores of the park, or head out to Rogers      reef by boat and still stay out of the strong currents that run through      Gabriola Passage.     </p>     <p>Facilities at this day-use only park include a grassy field, pit toilets,      picnic tables, hiking trails and an information shelter.     </p>     <p>      <strong>Park Size:</strong> 56 hectares      (21 hectares upland and 35 foreshore hectares)<br>      <strong>Date Established:</strong> July 26, 1971</p>","safetyInfo":null,"specialNotes":null,"locationNotes":null,"parkContact":null,"reservations":"","maps":"","natureAndCulture":null,"reconciliationNotes":"We honour their connection to the land and respect the importance of their diverse teachings, traditions and practices within these territories.

Provincial Park is a 5,573 hectare park lying 22 kilometres to the Northeast of the city of Vernon. This rounded mountain is typical feature of the Okanagan &ndash; Western Shuswap Highland regional landscape. A combination of slope and snow conditions make this an ideal area for winter recreation. Dependable snow depths and mild winter temperatures encourage activity throughout the winter in a variety of activities including cross-country skiing, snowshoeing and snowmobiling.</p><p>With its elevation change from the valley floor, Silver Star Provincial Park offers a refreshing break from the summer heat that is typical of the Okanagan. Hiking on wide, moderate grade trails offer both views<br>of the Okanagan Valley as well as the Monashee Mountain Range to the east and provides an easy access to hike into some sub alpine meadows awash with wildflowers.</p><p><strong>Established Date:</strong> March 21, 1989<br><strong>Park Size:</strong> 5,573 hectares</p>","safetyInfo":null,"specialNotes":null,"locationNotes":null,"parkContact":null,"reservations":"","maps":"Any maps listed are for information only; they may not represent legal boundaries and should not be used for navigation.<ul><li><a href=\"\"silver-star-map.pdf\"\" target=\"\"_blank\"\">Park Map <span class=\"\"fileinfo\"\">[PDF]</span></a><span class=\"\"note\"\">(October 9, 2019)</span></li><li><a href=\"\"silver-star-snowshoe-trails-map.pdf\"\" target=\"\"_blank\"\">Snowshoe Trails Map <span class=\"\"fileinfo\"\">[PDF]</span></a><span class=\"\"note\"\">(October 9, 2019)</span></li>    <li><a href=\"\"silver-star-snowshoe-trails-georeferenced.pdf\"\" target=\"\"_blank\"\">Snowshoe Trails Map &ndash; Georeferenced for use with mapping software such as Avenza <span class=\"\"fileinfo\"\">[PDF 13.5MB]</span></a><span class=\"\"note\"\">(December 9, 2019)</span> <br>     Disclaimer: Georeferenced maps are not be used as a sole source for navigation purposes.
